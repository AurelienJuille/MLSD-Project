# League of Legends FFate 

## Presentation pitch

**League of Legends** (LoL) players waste time in unwinnable games, with no early-game performance insight. They wonder if their game is still **worth it**.

FFate **predicts win probability after 15 minutes**, helping players decide if they should keep playing or forfeit.


With a simple **web dashboard**, FFate could predict winning probability after 15 minutes, and allow players to quickly spot their strengths, weaknesses. 

It would give players a **clearer view of the match** by showing which factors - like gold, or objectives - matter most, allowing **improved decision-making** (and potentially **reduced frustration**).

## Source code and pratical aspect
Everything related to the **EDA**, the **machine learning model**, the **application** and the **deployement** can be found in the [src folder](/src) folder.

## Documentation
All our documentation related to the different milestones are stored in the [documentation folder](documentation/).
