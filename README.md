# FFate 

## Presentation pitch

**League of Legends** (LoL) players waste time in unwinnable games, with no early-game performance insight. They wonder if their game is still **worth it**.

FFate **predicts win probability after 15 minutes**, helping players decide if they should keep playing or forfeit, reducing frustration and **improving decisionmaking**.

## Use case

For more information on our **use case**, you can check our [ML canvas](definition/USECASE.md).

## Model, data and source code

Everything related to the **EDA** and the **machine learning model** can be found in the [src folder](./src) folder.
