# League of Legends FFate 

## Presentation pitch

**League of Legends** (LoL) players waste time in unwinnable games, with no early-game performance insight. They wonder if their game is still **worth it**.

FFate **predicts win probability after 15 minutes**, helping players decide if they should keep playing or forfeit, reducing frustration and **improving decisionmaking**.
